# console.image
### Yet another console.image implementation, this time with multiple images support.
It only has one function: `console.image()`, no bloat. Yes, gifs also do work.

## console.video
It's an extension to console.image for displaying videos in the console, how amazing. Only single videos at a time for now. Also remember this requires a [modified version](https://paste.gg/p/anonymous/0a9cf9f9b26b4187b15703fa6726a895/files/23051537f09c42719637c38bc34d3421/raw) of [Gifshot](https://github.com/yahoo/gifshot). Mind this is totally impractical and is only usable with short videos, very short videos. Expect around a minute of loading time for 10 second video.
## How can I even use this?
1. Get whichever javascript file you want (`console.image.js` for editing and `console.image.min.js` for normal use).
2. Slap it in to your website or copy and paste it into the console.
3. Use it by doing `console.image(url1, url2, url3, ...)`, there can be arbitrary amount of urls for amount of images.
## Ok but I just wanna see how this works
Alright, I'll post some screenshots:
