# console.image
### Yet another console.image implementation, this time with multiple images support.
It only has one function: `console.image()`, no bloat. Yes, gifs also do work.
## How can I even use this?
1. Get whichever javascript file you want (`console.image.js` for editing, `console.image.min.js` for normal use, and `console.image.babel.min.js` for older browsers).
2. Slap it in to your website or copy and paste it into the console.
3. Use it by doing `console.image(url1, url2, url3, ...)`, there can be arbitrary amount of urls for amount of images.
## Ok but I just wanna see how this works
Alright, I'll post some screenshots:
